Neurons are functional units of the brain which contain long  projection called axons that pass on information to other neurons on other cells of the body. Although most of the cells in our bodies get replaced in a decade, neurons survive an entire lifetime. This opens up interesting questions as to how a neurons reapir themselves after constant assaults by the environment.

In the specific case of an injury, where an axon may be severed due to physical or chemical damage, it has been observed that certain neurons may grow their now severed axons to try an restablish connection with the severed parts of the body. This ability is the highest in young children and grows weaker with age. Further, certain neurons such as those in the Central Nervous System have very limited regenrative capacity, if any, while neurons in our peripheries retain a lot of regenerative potential.

We have utilized the model system _C. elegans_, which is a 1 millimeter long soil-dwelling nematode to address how this ability to regrow neurons is regulated. We utilize the Touch Receptor neurons in the worm due to their textbook morphology of 1 straight axon that covers half the worms length and is thus very easy to damage. We utilize a high powered multiphoton Ti::Sapphire LASER to introduce a small nick in the axon of the neuron without harming surrounding tissues of the worm. We then monitor the extent of regrowth and functional recovery of sensation for the worm.

My role in these projects has been at 2 stages:- early during regrowth initiation, and late during axon connection reestablishment.

In the first work covered in Kulakrni et _al._ (2021), my major contribution was in figuring out how cytoskeletal elements, microtubule and actin are regulated by the novel regulator of regeneration JIP3/UNC-16. Regulation of cytoskeletal elements is essential because the cytoskeleton of the cell is the major force generator which drives axon growth and extension. We found out that, in agreement with previous literature, UNC-16 regulates microtubule dynamics locally at the injury site. Interestingly, apart from its role in local regulation of microtubules post-injury, we found that loss of UNC-16 also increases the basal microtubule dynamics throughout the neuron, which in turn may prime the neuron for growth post-injury. Further actin dynamics were highly upregulated in loss of UNC-16 which was further consistent with the neuron being primed for regrowth. This priming however was not functioanl in nature, since although the neurons grew much more than usual, they grew in an undirected manner and thus did not always lead to functioanl recovery. Thus we found out that presence of UNC-16 is eesential to control neuron outgrowth to have functional recovery.

In the second work in Basu et _al._ (2017), my major contribution was to show that post regrowth, neurons sometimes re-establish connection with their severed axon pairs such that cargo can then be passed on from the neuronal cell body the distal regions. Interestingly, the neurons may not always re-form broken connections, and if the connection is lost for an extendid perios of time (1-2 days), the distal axon which had been severed from the cell body starts degenerating. This process of degeneration is prevented if the neuronal cell body connection is re-established and this can be seen as a resumption of cargo transport across the severed ends, as can be seen in the movie below.
