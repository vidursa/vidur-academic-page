The process of protein trafficking within the cell is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and ensuring proper organelle function. One of the key mechanisms that regulate this process is ubiquitination. In particular, the role of ubiquitination has gained significant attention in recent years due to its critical role in many cellular processes, such as DNA replication, cell division, and intracellular signaling.

Ubiquitination is a post-translational modification in which small protein chains, called ubiquitin, are added to other proteins. This process can alter protein activity in several ways.

First, ubiquitination can target a protein for degradation by the proteasome, which is a cellular complex responsible for breaking down damaged or unneeded proteins. By tagging a protein with ubiquitin, the proteasome recognizes the protein as being targeted for destruction, leading to its degradation and removal from the cell.

Second, ubiquitination can also regulate protein localization and interaction with other proteins. By adding ubiquitin to specific regions of a protein, the protein's localization within the cell can be altered, allowing it to interact with different proteins or become excluded from certain cellular compartments.

Finally, ubiquitination can alter the activity of a protein directly. In some cases, the addition of ubiquitin to a specific site on the protein can trigger a conformational change that affects its activity. In other cases, the ubiquitin modification can act as a signal for other proteins to bind to the modified protein and modulate its activity.

In the context of kinesin-mediated transport, ubiquitination can play a role in regulating the activity of kinesins and the cargo they carry. By controlling the localization, stability, and activity of kinesins and the proteins they transport, ubiquitination can help regulate various cellular processes, including cell division and intracellular trafficking.

In our work, we found out that ubiquitin can degrade kinesin-3/UNC-104 as well as regulate it independently. These independent functions are likely carried out by two different E3 ligases by modifying the kinesin at two distinct regions. One region within the stalk domain of the kinesin likely targets it to degradation, while modification of the kinesin near the cargo-binding (PH) domain, likely regulates the ability of kinesin to bind to cargo, thereby regulating its activity. This dysregulation of kinesin-cargo binding and hyperactivity upon loss of ubiqutiination leads to mislocalization of kinesins towards the distal ends of the cell, away from the region in the cell body they are generally needed.
