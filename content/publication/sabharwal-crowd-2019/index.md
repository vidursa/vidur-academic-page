abstract: High concentration of cytoskeletal filaments, organelles, and proteins along
  with the space constraints due to the axonâ€™s narrow geometry lead inevitably to
  intracellular physical crowding along the axon of a neuron. Local cargo movement
  is essential for maintaining steady cargo transport in the axon, and this may be
  impeded by physical crowding. Molecular motors that mediate active transport share
  movement mechanisms that allow them to bypass physical crowding present on microtubule
  tracks. Many neurodegenerative diseases, irrespective of how they are initiated,
  show increased physical crowding owing to the greater number of stalled organelles
  and structural changes associated with the cytoskeleton. Increased physical crowding
  may be a significant factor in slowing cargo transport to synapses, contributing
  to disease progression and culminating in the dying back of the neuronal process.
  This review explores the idea that physical crowding can impede cargo movement along
  the neuronal process. We examine the sources of physical crowding and strategies
  used by molecular motors that might enable cargo to circumvent physically crowded
  locations. Finally, we describe sub-cellular changes in neurodegenerative diseases
  that may alter physical crowding and discuss the implications of such changes on
  cargo movement.
