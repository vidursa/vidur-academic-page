 abstract = {We investigate the role of axonal transport in regulating neuronal mitochondrial density. We show that the density of mitochondria in the touch receptor neuron (TRN) of adult Caenorhabditis elegans is constant. Mitochondrial density and transport are controlled both by the Kinesin heavy chain and the Dynein-Dynactin complex. However, unlike in other models, the presence of mitochondria in C. elegans TRNs depends on a Kinesin light chain as well. Mutants in the three C. elegans miro genes do not alter mitochondrial density in the TRNs. Mutants in the Kinesin-1 associated proteins, UNC-16/JIP3 and UNC-76/FEZ1, show increased mitochondrial density and also have elevated levels of both the Kinesin Heavy and Light Chains in neurons. Genetic analyses suggest that, the increased mitochondrial density at the distal end of the neuronal process in unc-16 and unc-76 depends partly on Dynein. We observe a net anterograde bias in the ratio of anterograde to retrograde mitochondrial flux in the neuronal processes of unc-16 and unc-76, likely due to both increased Kinesin-1 and decreased Dynein in the neuronal processes. Our study shows that UNC-16 and UNC-76 indirectly limit mitochondrial density in the neuronal process by maintaining a balance in anterograde and retrograde mitochondrial axonal transport.},
