abstract: Neuronal regeneration after injury depends on the intrinsic growth potential
  of neurons. Our study shows that UNC-16, a Caenorhabditis elegans JIP3 homolog,
  inhibits axonal regeneration by regulating initiation and rate of regrowth. This
  occurs through the inhibition of the regeneration-promoting activity of the long
  isoform of DLK-1 and independently of the inhibitory short isoform of DLK-1. We
  show that UNC-16 promotes DLK-1 punctate localization in a concentration-dependent
  manner limiting the availability of the long isoform of DLK-1 at the cut site, minutes
  after injury. UNC-16 negatively regulates actin dynamics through DLK-1 and microtubule
  dynamics partially via DLK-1. We show that post-injury cytoskeletal dynamics in
  unc-16 mutants are also partially dependent on CEBP-1. The faster regeneration seen
  in unc-16 mutants does not lead to functional recovery. Our data suggest that the
  inhibitory control by UNC-16 and the short isoform of DLK-1 balances the intrinsic
  growth-promoting function of the long isoform of DLK-1 in vivo. We propose a model
  where UNC-16’s inhibitory role in regeneration occurs through both a tight temporal
  and spatial control of DLK-1 and cytoskeletal dynamics.
