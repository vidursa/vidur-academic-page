 abstract = {Neuronal regeneration after injury depends on the intrinsic growth potential of neurons. Our study shows that UNC-16, a Caenorhabditis elegans JIP3 homolog, inhibits axonal regeneration by regulating initiation and rate of regrowth. This occurs through the inhibition of the regeneration-promoting activity of the long isoform of DLK-1 and independently of the inhibitory short isoform of DLK-1. We show that UNC-16 promotes DLK-1 punctate localization in a concentration-dependent manner limiting the availability of the long isoform of DLK-1 at the cut site, minutes after injury. UNC-16 negatively regulates actin dynamics through DLK-1 and microtubule dynamics partially via DLK-1. We show that post-injury cytoskeletal dynamics in unc-16 mutants are also partially dependent on CEBP-1. The faster regeneration seen in unc-16 mutants does not lead to functional recovery. Our data suggest that the inhibitory control by UNC-16 and the short isoform of DLK-1 balances the intrinsic growth-promoting function of the long isoform of DLK-1 in vivo. We propose a model where UNC-16’s inhibitory role in regeneration occurs through both a tight temporal and spatial control of DLK-1 and cytoskeletal dynamics.},
