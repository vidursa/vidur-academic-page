abstract: Neuronal injury often leads to devastating consequences such as loss of
  senses or locomotion. Restoration of function after injury relies on whether the
  injured axons can find their target cells. Although fusion between injured proximal
  axon and distal fragment has been observed in many organisms, its functional significance
  is not clear. Here, using Caenorhabditis elegans mechanosensory neurons, we address
  this question. Using two femtosecond lasers simultaneously, we could scan and sever
  posterior lateral microtubule neurons [posterior lateral microtubules (PLMs)] on
  both sides of the worm. We showed that axotomy of both PLMs leads to a dramatic
  loss of posterior touch sensation. During the regenerative phase, only axons that
  fuse to their distal counterparts contribute to functional recovery. Loss of let-7
  miRNA promotes functional restoration in both larval and adult stages. In the L4
  stage, loss of let-7 increases fusion events by increasing the mRNA level of one
  of the cell-recognition molecules, CED-7. The ability to establish cytoplasmic continuity
  between the proximal and distal ends declines with age. Loss of let-7 overcomes
  this barrier by promoting axonal transport and enrichment of the EFF-1 fusogen at
  the growing tip of cut processes. Our data reveal the functional property of a regenerating
  neuron.
