	abstract = {Neuronal regeneration after injury depends on the intrinsic growth potential of neurons. Our study shows that UNC-16, a Caenorhabditis elegans JIP3 homolog, inhibits axonal regeneration by regulating initiation and rate of regrowth. This occurs through the inhibition of the regeneration-promoting activity of the long isoform of DLK-1 and independently of the inhibitory short isoform of DLK-1. We show that UNC-16 promotes DLK-1 punctate localization in a concentration-dependent manner limiting the availability of the long isoform of DLK-1 at the cut site, minutes after injury. UNC-16 negatively regulates actin dynamics through DLK-1 and microtubule dynamics partially via DLK-1. We show that post-injury cytoskeletal dynamics in unc-16 mutants are also partially dependent on CEBP-1. The faster regeneration seen in unc-16 mutants does not lead to functional recovery. Our data suggest that the inhibitory control by UNC-16 and the short isoform of DLK-1 balances the intrinsic growth-promoting function of the long isoform of DLK-1 in vivo. We propose a model where UNC-16’s inhibitory role in regeneration occurs through both a tight temporal and spatial control of DLK-1 and cytoskeletal dynamics.},

	abstract = {High concentration of cytoskeletal filaments, organelles, and proteins along with the space constraints due to the axon’s narrow geometry lead inevitably to intracellular physical crowding along the axon of a neuron. Local cargo movement is essential for maintaining steady cargo transport in the axon, and this may be impeded by physical crowding. Molecular motors that mediate active transport share movement mechanisms that allow them to bypass physical crowding present on microtubule tracks. Many neurodegenerative diseases, irrespective of how they are initiated, show increased physical crowding owing to the greater number of stalled organelles and structural changes associated with the cytoskeleton. Increased physical crowding may be a significant factor in slowing cargo transport to synapses, contributing to disease progression and culminating in the dying back of the neuronal process. This review explores the idea that physical crowding can impede cargo movement along the neuronal process. We examine the sources of physical crowding and strategies used by molecular motors that might enable cargo to circumvent physically crowded locations. Finally, we describe sub-cellular changes in neurodegenerative diseases that may alter physical crowding and discuss the implications of such changes on cargo movement.},

	abstract = {We investigate the role of axonal transport in regulating neuronal mitochondrial density. We show that the density of mitochondria in the touch receptor neuron (TRN) of adult Caenorhabditis elegans is constant. Mitochondrial density and transport are controlled both by the Kinesin heavy chain and the Dynein-Dynactin complex. However, unlike in other models, the presence of mitochondria in C. elegans TRNs depends on a Kinesin light chain as well. Mutants in the three C. elegans miro genes do not alter mitochondrial density in the TRNs. Mutants in the Kinesin-1 associated proteins, UNC-16/JIP3 and UNC-76/FEZ1, show increased mitochondrial density and also have elevated levels of both the Kinesin Heavy and Light Chains in neurons. Genetic analyses suggest that, the increased mitochondrial density at the distal end of the neuronal process in unc-16 and unc-76 depends partly on Dynein. We observe a net anterograde bias in the ratio of anterograde to retrograde mitochondrial flux in the neuronal processes of unc-16 and unc-76, likely due to both increased Kinesin-1 and decreased Dynein in the neuronal processes. Our study shows that UNC-16 and UNC-76 indirectly limit mitochondrial density in the neuronal process by maintaining a balance in anterograde and retrograde mitochondrial axonal transport.},

	abstract = {Neuronal injury often leads to devastating consequences such as loss of senses or locomotion. Restoration of function after injury relies on whether the injured axons can find their target cells. Although fusion between injured proximal axon and distal fragment has been observed in many organisms, its functional significance is not clear. Here, using Caenorhabditis elegans mechanosensory neurons, we address this question. Using two femtosecond lasers simultaneously, we could scan and sever posterior lateral microtubule neurons [posterior lateral microtubules (PLMs)] on both sides of the worm. We showed that axotomy of both PLMs leads to a dramatic loss of posterior touch sensation. During the regenerative phase, only axons that fuse to their distal counterparts contribute to functional recovery. Loss of let-7 miRNA promotes functional restoration in both larval and adult stages. In the L4 stage, loss of let-7 increases fusion events by increasing the mRNA level of one of the cell-recognition molecules, CED-7. The ability to establish cytoplasmic continuity between the proximal and distal ends declines with age. Loss of let-7 overcomes this barrier by promoting axonal transport and enrichment of the EFF-1 fusogen at the growing tip of cut processes. Our data reveal the functional property of a regenerating neuron.},
